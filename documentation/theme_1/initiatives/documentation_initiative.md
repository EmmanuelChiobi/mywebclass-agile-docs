# Initiative: Develop initial project documentation to establish a clear project scope
## Description
This initiative aims to create clear project documentation that outlines the scope of the project, its goals and objectives, timelines, deliverables, and potential constraints. This documentation will serve as a guide for all team members to understand the project's purpose and expected outcomes.
## Epics
