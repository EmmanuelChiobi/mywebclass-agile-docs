# User Story 4

As a project manager, I want to develop a detailed project plan and schedule so that I can track project progress effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
The project manager must create a comprehensive project plan and schedule that includes all tasks, dependencies, and deadlines. The plan should be broken down into smaller sub-tasks with estimated durations and potential delays or roadblocks accounted for. The schedule should be presented in a clear, easy-to-read format with milestone dates and deadlines for major deliverables. The plan and schedule should be shared with relevant stakeholders and regularly updated to track progress. Any changes must be promptly communicated to stakeholders.
