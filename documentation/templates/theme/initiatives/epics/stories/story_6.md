# User Story 6

As a project sponsor, I want to understand the project's timeline and milestones so that I can support the project effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
The project sponsor needs to have a clear understanding of the project's timeline and milestones, as well as the key deliverables at each stage, to support the project effectively. The project plan should be detailed and easily understood, presented in a clear format, and include estimated durations for each task and milestone. The sponsor should also have access to regular progress reports, and the project manager should communicate any changes to the timeline or milestones promptly. The sponsor should provide support and resources to ensure the project stays on track.
