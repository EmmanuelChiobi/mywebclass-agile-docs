# User Story 1

As a project manager, I want to define the project's objectives and constraints so that I can plan the project effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
The project manager should be able to clearly define the objectives and constraints of the project in order to plan it effectively. The objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). The constraints should be identified and documented, taking into consideration factors such as time, budget, resources, and scope. The project manager should review and approve the objectives and constraints with the stakeholders to ensure alignment and agreement. Finally, the project plan should accurately reflect the defined objectives and constraints. Once all these acceptance criteria have been met, the project manager will be able to plan the project effectively and ensure its success.
