# User Story 2

As a project team member, I want to identify key stakeholders and their roles so that I can ensure their requirements are met.

## Acceptance Criteria
The team member should create a stakeholder register that identifies all key stakeholders, their roles, and their requirements. The register should be reviewed and approved by the project manager or sponsor. The team member should also collaborate with the project manager to ensure that the stakeholders' requirements are appropriately documented and prioritized in the project plan. Finally, the team member should confirm that the requirements are met throughout the project's lifecycle and provide status updates to stakeholders as necessary.
